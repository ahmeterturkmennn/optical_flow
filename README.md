# Optical Flow Comparison: HCVFlow vs Lucas-Kanade

This repository contains the project developed for the **EE584 ‚Äì Machine Vision** course at METU. The project compares the performance of two optical flow estimation methods: the classical **Lucas-Kanade** algorithm and the modern deep learning-based **HCVFlow**.

## üîç Abstract

This project compares HCVFlow and Lucas-Kanade optical flow methods for EE584. HCVFlow, a learning-based model, handles blur and complex motion better, while Lucas-Kanade is faster but less robust. Results show the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in optical flow estimation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

### Lucas-Kanade
- Traditional optical flow algorithm based on image gradients
- Implemented using OpenCV‚Äôs `cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK`
- Fast and lightweight, but sensitive to blur and large motion

### HCVFlow
- Deep learning-based model designed for blurry and degraded videos
- Uses hierarchical cost volumes for flow estimation
- Adapted from the official repo: [HCVFlow GitHub](https://github.com/gangweix/HCVFlow/tree/main)
- I added **video inference support** to run it on full video files

## üß™ Experiments

- Input: Videos with motion blur and complex movement
- Compared flow field quality visually and functionally
- Focused on robustness to blur and motion consistency

## üìä Results

- **Lucas-Kanade**: Fast, interpretable, but struggles with blur
- **HCVFlow**: Accurate and robust, especially under challenging visual conditions
