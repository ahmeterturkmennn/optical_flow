# optical_flow
This project compares HCVFlow and Lucas-Kanade optical flow methods for EE584. HCVFlow, a learning-based model, handles blur and complex motion better, while Lucas-Kanade is faster but less robust. Results show the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in optical flow estimation.
